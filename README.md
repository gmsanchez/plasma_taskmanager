Customization of Plasma Task Manager

The intented behavior should work as follows:

1. When the user clicks an icon of an application that is not focused, the Task Manager should change to the last active window of the application (whether the application has one or more windows).

2. When the user right clicks on an application icon, the context menu should also display the list of windows of the application (if there are any).
